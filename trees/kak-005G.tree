\p{I will be reading and reviewing one paper a week (tentatively). More accurately, I will allocate ~6hrs a week to read a paper. However much I accomplish in this time will determine the actual rate of these reviews. This will be an infinitely expanding blog to keep track of all of these reviews. More ambitiously, I may try to reproduce any paper that I find particularly interesting. These special papers might be a Paper of the Month!. See [upcoming papers](kak-007N) and feel free to request!}
