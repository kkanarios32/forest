[{"DOI": "10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294697", "abstract": "Motion planning for an autonomous vehicle is most challenging for scenarios such as large, multi-lane, and unsignalized intersections in the presence of dense traffic. In such situations, the motion planner has to deal with multiple crossing-points to reach an objective in a safe, comfortable, and efficient way. In addition, motion planning challenges include real-time computation and scalability to complex scenes with many objects and different road geometries. In this work, we propose a motion planning system addressing these challenges. We enable real-time applicability of a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm with a deep-learning heuristic. We learn a fast evaluation function from accurate, but non real-time models. While using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques we maintain a clear separation between making predictions and making decisions. We reduce the complexity of the search model and benchmark the proposed agent against multiple methods: rules-based, MCTS, A<sup>*</sup> search, deep learning, and Model Predictive Control. We show that our agent outperforms these other agents in a variety of challenging scenarios, where we benchmark safety, comfort and efficiency metrics.", "accessed": {"date-parts": [[2025, 3, 19]]}, "author": [{"family": "Weingertner", "given": "Philippe"}, {"family": "Ho", "given": "Minnie"}, {"family": "Timofeev", "given": "Andrey"}, {"family": "Aubert", "given": "S\u00e9bastien"}, {"family": "Pita-Gil", "given": "Guillermo"}], "container-title": "2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)", "id": "weingertnerMonteCarloTree2020", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2020, 9]]}, "keyword": "Acceleration,Complexity theory,Dynamics,Planning,Real-time systems,Safety,Search problems", "page": "1-7", "title": "Monte Carlo Tree Search With Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning", "type": "paper-conference", "original_bibtex": "@inproceedings{weingertnerMonteCarloTree2020,\n title = {Monte {{Carlo Tree Search With Reinforcement Learning}} for {{Motion Planning}}},\n author = {Weingertner, Philippe and Ho, Minnie and Timofeev, Andrey and Aubert, S{\\'e}bastien and {Pita-Gil}, Guillermo},\n year = {2020},\n doi = {10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294697},\n urldate = {2025-03-19},\n booktitle = {2020 {{IEEE}} 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} ({{ITSC}})},\n pages = {1--7},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/YRS3JGCL/Weingertner et al. - 2020 - Monte Carlo Tree Search With Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning.pdf;/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/K56QQ2MD/9294697.html},\n keywords = {Acceleration,Complexity theory,Dynamics,Planning,Real-time systems,Safety,Search problems},\n abstract = {Motion planning for an autonomous vehicle is most challenging for scenarios such as large, multi-lane, and unsignalized intersections in the presence of dense traffic.
