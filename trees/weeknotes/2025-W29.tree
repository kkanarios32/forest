\title{Weekly Review 2025-W29}

\section{The Quantified Me}{
  \p{This section is in large part to gaslight myself on the internet into being more productive but with the information provided let us introspect on what happened this week. }
  \p{\strong{Coding:} I will now proceed to justify and provide excuses on what went wrong this week. On Monday, we see that I spent a large part of my time on this forest. However, this was actually writing up my notes on [lecture 3](ESQ3) of [CS336](0085). My goal of roughly 1ish hour of miscellaneous learning a day snowballed into what was seemingly #{4} hours of random activity, where I spiraled into [MQA](W4YP). I am thinking of putting this self-study on the backburner in favor of focusing on [three easy pieces](0084) until the semester starts. I intend to take two courses on what is essentially LLMs systems this fall (very excited), so I might as well not double dip now. I am thinking about using projects 1 and 2 of this course to develop my own working LLM implementation. I can then use it as reference to try out and learn any new optimization tricks like [MQA](W4YP) or [[TJLA]], etc. 
  \p{These plots also finally confirm what I noticed as a general trend in my working life. Namely, I spend a lot of time working Monday-Thu because of my weekly meetings with my advisor on Thursday. However, I do not properly make use of the rest of the week. This is a trend I hope to improve upon in future entries.}

  \p{\strong{Rest of (computer) life:} This week I did a pretty good job staying on task (at least on my computer). Very little brainrot was consumed and a decent amount of work was accomplished. Tune in next week to see if we can keep that up!

\section{VO2 Max(ing)}{
  \ul{
    \li{\strong{Current VO2 Max}: 53}
    \li{\strong{Weekly Mileage}: 17.2}
  }
  \p{Unfortunately, I missed one run this week. The same one I miss every week: Sunday. I will still blame the shin splints, but this may be the last week I can do so (finally!). I am still maintaining a pretty good SPM, but I need to get some more lower HR runs in. From here on out, we should not dip below 20 miles a week. I have some travel coming up at [RLC](rlc), but I should be able to still run while I am there.}

\section{Goals for next week}{
\p{This is another section, where I gaslight myself into some accountability on the internet.}
\p{For my imaginary audience, you should have a lot to look forward to in the next week. Namely, 
\ol{
\li{Look forward to an in-depth blog on [flow matching](lipmanFlowMatchingGenerative2023) to accompany my [slides](FMTD).}
\li{I also should have two new [research bible](005G) entries one on the [forward backward representation](touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021) and the other on [hierarchical rl](nachumNearOptimalRepresentationLearning2019).}
\li{For my [OS adventure](0084), you should see me (hopefully) get through memory virtualization.
However, I should definitely get to at least the TLB. Unlikely, I will continue to do all the exercises (because I spend more time writing them down than doing them). I might do one or two of the projects, but they are quite intimidating TBD.}
}
Check back in next week to see if I am productive! Also TBD if in the future I will put research-related stuff in this review.
