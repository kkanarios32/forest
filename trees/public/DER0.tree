\title{Operations that preserve convexity}
\p{The following operations preserve [convexity](004D)}
\ul{
    \li{\strong{Nonnegative weighted sums:} if #{f_1, \ldots, f_n} are convex and #{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n > 0} then we have #{f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \alpha_i f_i(\boldsymbol{x})} is convex}
    \li{\strong{Pointwise maximum:} if #{f_1, \ldots, f_n} are convex then #{f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \max_i \{f_i(\boldsymbol{x})\}} is convex }
