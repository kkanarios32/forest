\title{#{\sigma}-field of RV}
\taxon{Definition}
\p{The #{\sigma}-field generated by a [[001W]] is the smallest #{\sigma}-field such that the [[001W]] is [measurable](001W). For a sequence of [[001W]]'s, the [[000O]] generated by them is the smallest [[000O]], such that each of the [[001W]]'s is measurable.
